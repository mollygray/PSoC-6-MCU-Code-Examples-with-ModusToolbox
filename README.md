# Introduction
In general, each code example is in a separate repository. This makes it easy for you to get just what you need. Occasionally two or more examples work with each other. For example, perhaps a SPI Master and SPI Slave. You'll find closely related examples that work with each other in a single repository.

This ReadMe describes the available code examples for PSoC 6 MCU, a single chip solution for the emerging IoT devices. PSoC 6 MCU bridges the gap between expensive, power hungry application processors and low‑performance microcontrollers (MCUs). The ultra‑low‑power, dual-core architecture of PSoC 6 MCU offers the processing performance needed by IoT devices, eliminating the tradeoffs between power and performance.

Feel free to explore the code example source files and let's innovate together!

# Navigating the Repository

The examples provided on this GitHub page helps you to get acquainted with PSoC 6 MCU. As noted, for the most part each code example is in its own repository. Use the [Code Example List](#code-example-list) below to find what you're looking for. Or, use GitHub's search capabilities to search this site.

Put a picture in here. :)

All the code examples in this repository comes with well documented design guidelines to help you understand the design and how to develop it.

#### PSoC 6 MCU Application Notes
Application notes are available on the Cypress website to assist you with designing your PSoC application: [A list of PSoC 6 MCU ANs](http://www.cypress.com/psoc6an)
#### PSoC 6 MCU Component Datasheets
PSoC Creator utilizes "components" as interfaces to functional Hardware (HW). Each component in PSoC Creator has an associated datasheet that describes the functionality, APIs, and electrical specifications for the HW. You can access component datasheets in PSoC Creator by right-clicking a component on the schematic page or by going through the component library listing. You can also access component datasheets from the Cypress website: [PSoC 6 Component Datasheets](http://www.cypress.com/documentation/component-datasheets)
