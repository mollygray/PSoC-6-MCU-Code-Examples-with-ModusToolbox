# Code Examples 

Cypress provides a rich set of code examples for the PSoC 6 MCU, using the ModusToolbox IDE. PSoC 6 MCU bridges the gap between expensive, power hungry application processors and low‑performance microcontrollers (MCUs). The ultra‑low‑power, dual-core architecture of PSoC 6 MCU offers the processing performance needed by IoT devices, eliminating the tradeoffs between power and performance.

Code examples are grouped by category. The same code example may appear in more than one category. All the code examples come with well documented design guidelines to help you understand the design and how to develop it. Feel free to explore the code example source files and let's innovate together! 

This ReadMe also includes information about ModusToolbox software, links to avaliable kits, and programming resources for PSoC 6 MCU. See each code example to learn what kits are supported by the example.
